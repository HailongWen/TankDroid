# TankDroid

This is an android app to control my RC tank equipped with a Raspberry Pi 3 and a Grovepi Board.
The actual steering is done with a Bluetooth gamepad.
In addition my tank has to cameras which are streamed to the app as MJPEG streams.

The code running on the tank is written in C, and published here:
